# Session 4 - Database Event and Alarm Enrichment

## Introduction

We have looked at various techniques for creating event and alarm configurations using SNMP Mibs.

Often in a real world network management situation it is necessary to modify or enhance these management objects. 
In this session we will see how to enhance or modify events and alarms to provide more meaningful service impact information to users. 

In [Exercise-4-1](../session4/Exercise-4-1.md) we will look at the OpenNMS Database and the Event Translator.

In [Exercise-4-2](../session4/Exercise-4-2.md) we will create a real event translator example for our smart motorway.

In [Exercise-4-3](../session4/Exercise-4-3.md) we will look at how Drools Rules can be used to modify the alarm behaviour
