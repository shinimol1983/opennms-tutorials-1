# Exercise 4-2 

In this exercise we will translate received traps into a set of modified traps using the [event translator](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/33/operation/deep-dive/events/event-translator.html).

## Scenario

In [Exercise-3-3](../session3/Exercise-3-3.md) we had multiple cameras and each camera was identified by its IP address.
When a trap was sent from a camera, OpenNMS used the `from` IP address in the trap to determine which camera node had generate the event.

Imagine now that the cameras no longer have an IP address and no longer send traps to OpenNMS.
Instead all of the cameras are controlled from a single `camera-controller`. 
The cameras themselves are not directly manageable from OpenNMS but the `camera-controller` monitors the cameras and will send traps to OpenNMS if it detects any problems with any of the cameras.

The operator wishes to show the status of all the cameras on a map, so they each need to be represented as unique OpenNMS nodes which may or may not have alarms associated with them.
However, instead of each camera sending traps directly to OpenNMS with a unique IP address associated with each camera, the `camera-controller` sends all the traps from its own IP address on behalf of the cameras it manages.

Each trap now has an additional varbind that names the camera to which the trap refers.

If all the traps come from the same `camera-controller` IP address, how will OpenNMS know which camera has an alarm?

The answer in this case is to use the [event translator](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/33/operation/deep-dive/events/event-translator.html)

## Setup

You should use the docker compose project under the `EventTranslator` folder for this exercise

[/session4/EventTranslator/minimal-minion-activemq](../session4/EventTranslator/minimal-minion-activemq).

The cameras and camera controllers are defined in the [camera-locations.xml](../session4/EventTranslator/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/imports/camera-locations.xml) requisition.

You should import this requisition to define the cameras and `camera-controller` when you start OpenNMS.
The cameras are named after the fashion; `camera_001`, `camera_002` etc. 
Each camera also has an asset record defining the `latitude` and `longitude` of its location which creates the following map;

![alt text](../session4/images/chubb-cameras.png "Figure chubb-cameras.png")

The camera nodes are themselves not monitored by OpenNMS and do not have any interface definitions, so they are in effect `dummy nodes` which can have alarms associated with them. 

Each camera has a unique `cameraIdentifier` to identify it in the `camera-controller` and on OpenNMS.

The traps sent from the `camera-controller` follow exactly the same pattern as the traps in the previous exercise but they all have an extra string varbind which contains the `cameraIdentifier`.

Example traps are provided for camera_008 in [CAMERA-CONTROLLER Trap Examples](../session4/TrapExamplesCAMERA-CONTROLLER.md)

The traps now have an additional `cameraIdentifier` varbind identified by the `oid`, `.1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.7.0` and containing the camera name in text  (e.g. `camera_008 `).

These new traps match the OpenNMS event configuration defined in [etc/events/CAMERA-CONTROLLER-MIB.events.xml](../session4/EventTranslator/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/events/CAMERA-CONTROLLER-MIB.events.xml) 

You need to design an event translator configuration which will translate the events from these new traps into similar events to those defined in [Exercise 3.1](../session3/Exercise-3-1.md) but with the correct `nodeid` corresponding to the `cameraIdentifier` in the traps.

A starting point is provided here [etc/translator-configuration.xml](../session4/EventTranslator/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/translator-configuration.xml) 
This is based upon the standard translations included with OpenNMS. 

We need to translate each of the incoming events so that a new event is created with the correct node id. 
To do this, the event translator must do a lookup in the database to find the correct node id based on it's node label matching the cameraId in the trap.

You will see in the file there is already a configuration `Improved LinkDown/LinkUp events`  which looks up nodes using sql. 
You need to do a similar event lookup for each of the events defined in [etc/events/CAMERA-CONTROLLER-MIB.events.xml](../session4/EventTranslator/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/events/CAMERA-CONTROLLER-MIB.events.xml) 

A starting point is provided at the end of the file `Translations FOR CAMERA CONTROLLER EVENTS`. 

```
    <!-- Translations FOR CAMERA CONTROLLER EVENTS -->
    <event-translation-spec uei="uei.opennms.org/traps/CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB/healthChange/panMotor">
      <mappings>
        <mapping preserve-snmp-data="false">

          <!-- you need to change this to look up the nodeid from the nodelabel -->
          <assignment name="nodeid" type="field">
              <value type="constant" result="5" />

             <!-- this might help :) -->
             <!--   <value type="sql" result="xxx"> -->
             <!--          <value type="parameter" name="xxxx" matches=".*" result="${0}" /> -->
             <!--  </value> -->

          </assignment>

        </mapping>
      </mappings>
    </event-translation-spec>

    <event-translation-spec uei="uei.opennms.org/traps/CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB/healthChangeClear/panMotor-clear">
      <mappings>   
         <mapping preserve-snmp-data="false">
            
          <!-- you need to change this to look up the nodeid from the nodelabel -->
          <assignment name="nodeid" type="field">
              <value type="constant" result="5" />
          </assignment>

        </mapping>
      </mappings>
    </event-translation-spec>
```

Modify this to do a database lookup for the `nodeid` based on the `nodelabel` contained in the varbind with the oid `.1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.7.0` .

You will find the answer here (but try the exercise first).
