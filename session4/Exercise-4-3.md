# Exercise 4-3 

## Scenario

The configuration in [Exercise-4-2 Answer](../session4/Exercise-4-2-answer.md) worked well but the customer complained that there are too many possible alarms. 
They did not want to see all of the detailed alarms but a simplified set of service alarms which consolidated the possible alarms into five groups.
Thus they wanted to see a `group5` service alarm if any of the alarms in `group5` were present or a `group1` service alarm if any of the alarms in group1 were present.

The grouping of alarm uei's is listed in the table below.

## Business Service Monitor - possible solution
Now you should realise that it would possible to do this using the `Business Service Monitor` to define a business service alarm for all of the possible reduction keys in each group for each camera. 
An example of one group5 alarm is shown below

![alt text](../session4/images/BSMReductionKey1.png "Figure BSMReductionKey1.png ")

This shows up in the topology like so.
![alt text](../session4/images/BSMReductionKey2.png "Figure BSMReductionKey2.png ")

The problem with this approach is that, while alarm grouping is possible, you need to build a configuration for every camera which quickly becomes unwieldy and error prone.

An alternative approach is to build a business rules configuration which can be extended to any number of cameras.

## Drools Rules Solution

Before proceeding to [Exercise-4-3](../session4/Exercise-4-3.md), shutdown and clear the database for the EventTranslator project.
```
cd EventTranslator/minimal-minion-activemq
docker compose down -v
```
You should use the docker compose project under the `drools-corellation` folder for this exercise
[session4/drools-correlation/minimal-minion-activemq/](../session4/drools-correlation/minimal-minion-activemq/).


We also looked in [Session 2](../session2/README.md) at how business servicing monitoring can build a graph of services which allows us to determine the business impact of a monitored service failure.
