# Exercise Service Monitoring

## service 3 tier network

Often sites are made scalable and more resiliant through load-balancing a number of servers. 
In this example we have installed three wordpress servers behind an NGINX load balancer.

All the servers share the same MariaDB database which also maintains the session data across the servers.

![alt text](../session2/images/examplenetwork-loadbalance.drawio.png "Figure examplenetwork-loadbalance.drawio.png")

You can see the wordpress configuration if you look at the [docker-compose.yml](../session2/minimal-minion-activemq/docker-compose.yaml) configuration.
This contains a section for the OpenNMS containers, a section for three netsnmp containers (for a seperate set of exercises) and at the bottom a section for the Wordpress containers.

You will see three Wordpress containers; wordpress1, wordpress2  and wordpress3. 
These all share the same data volume `wp_data` so that the are effectively clones of each other.

You will also see a wordpress-cli container. 
This container waits for 20 seconds to allow the database and the containers to start before initialisinf the word press containers, giving them their admin username and password and an initial front page name for the site using the command:

```
      /bin/sh -c '
      sleep 20;
      wp core install --path="/var/www/html/wordpress" --url="https://localhost/wordpress" --title="Local Wordpress By Docker" --admin_user=admin --admin_password=secret --admin_email=foo@bar.com
      '
```
After this initialisation step, this container exits.
Without wordpress-cli, you would have the manually configure the wordpress instance on first start.

The nginx configuration is held in [wp-load-balencer-with-ssl.conf](..\session2\minimal-minion-activemq\container-fs\nginx\conf.d\wp-load-balencer-with-ssl.conf).
THis sets up https termination and the round robin request forwarding the the three wordpress servers.

docker compose up -d

## Testing Word press and the load balancer

The three wordpress instances share the same configuration and static data.
They also connect to the same database.

The `wordpress-cli` container configures the wordpress instances with an initial user and front page blog post.

All three containers sit behind the nginx container which both terminates the https/tls traffic and acts as a round robin load balancer.

browse to `https://localhost` and view the following  landing page with links to wordpress and wordpress admin pages

![alt text](../session2/images/nginx-html.png "Figure nginx-html.png")

![alt text](../session2/images/wordpress1.png "Figure wordpress1.png")

The wordpress admin page allows login with a username and password 
* Username admin
* Password secret


![alt text](../session2/images/wordpress2.png "Figure wordpress2.png")

The wordpress admin page should show up as below.

![alt text](../session2/images/wordpress3.png "Figure wordpress3.png")

To test that the load balancing is working, open three terminals use each one to view the word press logs for each of the wordpress instances

```
docker compose logs -f wordpress1

docker compose logs -f wordpress2

docker compose logs -f wordpress3
```

If you repeatedly refresh the Wordpress login page, you should see the logs advance one at a time for each of the wordpress instances as they are polled by the load balancer.

## Monitoring with OpenNMS

OpenNMS can monitor the load balancer, each of the word press servers and the state of the database.



browse to http://localhost:8980/opennms and login using user:admin password:admin

Go to the requisitions page and inspect the test-wordpress requisition.

THis is backed by the requisition import file [test-wordpress.xml](../session2/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/imports/test-wordpress.xml)
Synchronise this requisition and see each of the servers in the nodes page


try stopping one of the servers and see what happens

```
docker compose stop wordpress1
```
