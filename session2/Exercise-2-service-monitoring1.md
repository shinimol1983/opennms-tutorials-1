# Exercise Service Monitoring

## service 3 tier network

Often sites are made scalable through load-balancing a number of servers. 
In this example we have installed three wordpress servers behind an NGINX load balancer.

All there server share the same MariaDB database which also maintains the session data across the servers.

```
cd minimal-minion-activemq
docker compose up -d

## Testing Word press and the load balancer

The three wordpress instances share the same configuration and static data.
They also connect to the same database.

The `wordpress-cli` container configures the wordpress instances with an initial user and front page blog post.

All three containers sit behind the nginx container which both terminates the https/tls traffic and acts as a round robin load balancer.

browse to `https://localhost` and view the following  landing page with links to wordpress and wordpress admin pages

![alt text](../session2/images/wordpress1.png "Figure wordpress1.png")

The wordpress admin page allows login with a username and password 
* Username admin
* Password secret

The wordpress admin page should show up as below.

To test that the load balancing is working, open three terminals use each one to view the word press logs for each of the wordpress instances

```
docker compose logs -f wordpress1

docker compose logs -f wordpress2

docker compose logs -f wordpress3
```

If you repeatedly refresh the Wordpress login page, you should see the logs advance one at a time for each of the wordpress instances as they are polled by the load balancer.

## Monitoring with OpenNMS

OpenNMS can monitor the load balancer, each of the word press servers and the state of the database.
