# Session 5 - Performance

[Main Menu](../README.md) | [Session 5](../session5/README.md)

## Introduction

In [Session 2](../session3/README.md#service-and-web-site-monitoring) we saw how OpenNMS can be used to poll the availability of services on a regular basis using `synthetic transactions`.
The service monitoring function detects and polls services to ensure they are up.
It only stores the response time for each service request and events corresponding to the service life-cycle (discover, service up, service down etc).

In this session we will look at a more advanced OpenNMS [Performance Data Collection](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/30/operation/performance-data-collection/introduction.html) capability which collects performance statistics on a regular interval from the service itself.

## Overview

The majority of performance data collection in SNMP deployments is performed using SNMP but other performance data protocols are supported including plain text/CSV, ReST/XML/Json, Java JMX and WBEM. 

For more details see [Performance Data Collectors](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/30/reference/performance-data-collection/collectors.html). 
In this session we will concentrate on SNMP data collection.

| Config File | Description |
|:------------|-------------|
| [etc/collectd-configuration.xml](../../main/pristine-opennms-config-files/etc-pristine/collectd-configuration.xml)|This file configures `collectd` to set up multiple polling packages that define filters to determine which IP addresses or node categories to collect each package from.<br>Packages can contain more than one protocol for data collection e.g SNMP, JMX, XML. Each protocol definition must reference the java class which is used to perform the collection. Each of these classes/protocols will have a different set of configuration files. |
| [etc/datacollection-config.xml](../../main/pristine-opennms-config-files/etc-pristine/datacollection-config.xml)| This file provides the configuration for SNMP data collection. It references files in the [etc/datacollection  folder](../../main/pristine-opennms-config-files/etc-pristine/datacollection/). For instance see the file [etc/datacollection/netsnmp.xml](../../main/pristine-opennms-config-files/etc-pristine/datacollection/netsnmp.xml) |
| [etc/datacollection-config.xml](../../main/pristine-opennms-config-files/etc-pristine/xml-datacollection-config.xml)| This file provides the configuration for XML and Json data collection. It references files in the [etc/xml-datacollection  folder](../../main/pristine-opennms-config-files/etc-pristine/xml-datacollection).<BR>A similar pattern exists for other data collection protocols such as JMX |

The relationship between SNMP data collection configuration files is illustrated below
