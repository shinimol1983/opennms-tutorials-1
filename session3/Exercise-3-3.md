# Exercise 3-3 More complex case study example

## Introduction

In the last section we saw how to create an event and alarm using an unformatted OpenNMS event from an unknown trap.
In this section we will attempt a worked example using a manufactures published SNMP MIBS.

![alt text](../session3/images/MotorwayCamera.jpg "Figure MotorwayCamera.jpg")

Road side cameras are used to provide surveillance for [smart motorways](https://www.highwaysmagazine.co.uk/chubb-launches-new-camera-system-for-smart-motorways/6703) and CHUBB, who manufacture these cameras, have published a MIB for camera event traps sent from each of their cameras. 
In this example we will import this MIB into OpenNMS and create camera alarms.

**_NOTE:_** Disclaimer: This exercise is provided as a training example. The CHUBB MIBs used may not be the latest specified by the manufacturer.

## Getting started
In this example we will use the same network as we used in [Session 2](../session2/README.md). 

However we want to start with a clean system because instead of creating the configuration files inside the container, we will inject them using docker. 

Use the new [session3/minimal-minion-activemq](../session3/minimal-minion-activemq/) project.

(Note you should be copying this session into your myPracticeCourseWork folder if you want to keep a forked copy of your work). 

```
# make sure the old database and configuration is gone by deleting the volumes using the -v option
cd minimal-minion-activemq
docker compose down -v

# restart opennms
docker compose up -d

# follow the logs until OpennMS is up.
# this will take a while because we are recreating the database
docker compose logs -f horizon

# OpenNMS will be up around the time when you see the logs pass the following lines
horizon  | [INFO] Invoking start on object OpenNMS:Name=PerspectivePoller
horizon  | [INFO] Invocation start successful for MBean OpenNMS:Name=PerspectivePoller

# Ctrl-c to exit

```
Once OpenNMS is running, open a session at http:\\localhost:8980 (username: admin password: admin)

The provided [test-network1-requisition](../minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/imports/test-network1-requisition.xml) now has two cameras in different subnets.

| container | Native SNMP port | Host Exposed SNMP Port | internal ip address | node label | foreign id | location (minion) |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| chubb_camera_01 | 161        | 11561                  | 172.20.0.103        | chubb_camera_01 | chubb_camera_01 | Default |
| chubb_camera_02 | 161        | 11661                  | 172.20.2.103        | chubb_camera_02 | chubb_camera_02 | minion1-location |

You will need to import the test-network1-requisition and add the `chubb` snmp community string for chubb_camera_02 and chubb_camera_02 as covered in [Exercise-2-1](../session2/Exercise-2-1.md)

You should now have the full test network including the cameras ready for you to design the configuration.

Log into both cameras and check you can walk the mib locally

```
docker compose exec chubb_camera_01 bash

# check that snmpsim is working when you walk the MIB
 snmpwalk -v 2c -On -c chubb localhost
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: M1 (TUNNEL) 0/2L
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.1.6
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 = Timeticks: (404669) 1:07:26.69
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 = STRING: Highways England - 03001235000
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: 00021,20002
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 = STRING: 0002L
```

Ping horizon to make sure you can see it.

```
ping horizon
```

Try sending the following trap from chubb_camera_01 to horizon using netsnmp.
You should see an unformatted event from chubb_camera_01 in the OpenNMS event list.

```
# send a trap to horizon
snmptrap -v 2c -c public horizon:1162 ""  .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.0.1    .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.1.0 i 0  .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.5.0 i 1
```
Do the same for chubb_camera_02 but this time send the trap to minion1

```
docker compose exec chubb_camera_02 bash

ping minion1

# send a trap to minion1

snmptrap -v 2c -c public minion1:1162 ""  .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.0.1    .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.1.0 i 0  .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.5.0 i 1
```

If you are receiving unformatted events in OpenNMS, your connectivity is working fine and we are ready to format the traps.

## Parsing a MIB

OpenNMS provides a web based tool to read SNMP mibs and generate configurations. 
The Web UI is functional but a bit limited in scope within a container so we will be better off generating the configuration files from the UI and then copying them outside the container for editing.

To open the Mib compiler go to the Admin Page (Cogs) ![alt text](../session3/images/cogs.png "Figure cogs.png") and select Additional Tools > SNMP MIB Compiler.

![alt text](../session3/images/provisioning-mib.png "Figure provisioning-mib.png")

This will open the MIB compiler.

You can see there is a button labelled `Upload MIB` which allows us to upload any mib files into OpenNMS for processing

All of the MIB files we will need are in the following folder in your checked out project:

[session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/snmpsim/mibs](../session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/snmpsim/mibs)

The MIB file we will need to create our configuration is [CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA.mib](../session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/snmpsim/mibs/CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA.mib). 

Upload this file and right click on it and select `compile`.


![alt text](../session3/images/mibcompiler1-error.png "Figure mibcompiler1-error.png")

You will get the following error: `[ERROR] Dependencies required: <b>[CHUBB-ROOT, SNMPv2-CONF, SNMPv2-SMI]</b>`

If you examine the MIB file you will see that it requires definitions taken from other MIB files (CHUBB-ROOT, SNMPv2-CONF, SNMPv2-SMI).

```
CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

IMPORTS
    chubb, products
        FROM CHUBB-ROOT
    MODULE-COMPLIANCE, NOTIFICATION-GROUP, OBJECT-GROUP
        FROM SNMPv2-CONF            -- RFC 2580
    Integer32, Unsigned32, MODULE-IDENTITY, NOTIFICATION-TYPE, OBJECT-TYPE
        FROM SNMPv2-SMI;            -- RFC 2578

...
```

So in order to use this MIB we must import and compile its dependencies first and since each of the dependencies also requires other MIB files, you may have a bit of trial and error to upload and compile the files in the correct order.

All of the dependencies are also in the folder [session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/snmpsim/mibs](../session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/snmpsim/mibs)

Once you have upload and compiled all of the files, you will be in a position to generate the event definitions by right clicking on the `CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB.mib` file and selecting `generate events` as shown in the image below.

![alt text](../session3/images/generateEvents.png "Figure generateEvents.png")

We will keep the default base UEI definition as `uei.opennms.org/traps/CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB`

The trap definitions in the camera mib will be converted into 4 new OpenNMS events ;

![alt text](../session3/images/GeneratedEvents1.png "Figure GeneratedEvents1.png")

If you select `save event file`, you will see from the log that a new event definition file has been created `CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB.events.xml` containing 4 event definitions and that a reference to this file has been placed in the `eventconf.xml` file

```

```

## Testing the parsed mib events

You will see from the log messages that OpenNMS has modified `eventconf.xml` and added the new file `CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB.events.xml` inside the container.

OpenNMS should now be able to process the trap we sent previously from the chubb_camera_01.
Try sending the trap again.

```
docker compose exec chubb_camera_01 bash

snmptrap -v 2c -c public horizon:1162 ""  .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.0.1    .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.1.0 i 0  .1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.5.0 i 1
```

You should now see new events being generated in the OpenNMS event list.
The event is no longer an unrecognised event but is an event defined from the CHUBB mib.

![alt text](../session3/images/chubb-basic-events.png "Figure chubb-basic-events.png")

The trap we sent was a healthChange trap OID `.1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.0.1` with two varbinds; healthChangeReason `.1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.1.0`  and faultState `.1.3.6.1.4.1.52330.6.2.5.0`.

The `healthChangeReason` can have one of twelve values corresponding to the nature of the fault:

* panMotor(0) tiltMotor(1) zoomMotor(2) apertureMotor(3) focusMotor(4) wiperMotor(5) heater(6) fluidLevel(7) videoSignal(8) housingTamper(9) washerMotorFault(10) configPlugFault(11) tvbuCameraCommsFault(12) 

and the faultState can have one of two values:

* clear(0) triggered(1).

So we can see that even though we only have one `healthChange` trap definition, it can correspond to the raising or clearing of up to twelve different independent problems which can occur in any combination in the camera.

You will also see that all the generated events still have an `Indeterminate` severity. 
We have no idea from the event whether a `washerMotorFault` is more or less critical to deal with than a `videoSignal` fault.

## Creating more useful Event and Alarm Definitions

We are now going to turn the event definitions generated from the mib into a more useful configuration which generates alarms with different severities.

### create an overlay configuration in docker compose

First, we need to extract the two event files we have generated inside the container so that we can modify and re-inject them as an overlay to the container.

We can copy the files from inside the container into the local project directory using the docker compose `cp` command

```
docker compose cp horizon:/usr/share/opennms/etc/events/CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB.events.xml .
docker compose cp horizon:/usr/share/opennms/etc/eventconf.xml .
```
This will copy the files into the root of your docker compose project for you to work with.

**_NOTE:_** Example copies of these raw files are also provided in the [session3/minimal-minion-activemq/example-configurations/events-generated-from-mib](../session3/minimal-minion-activemq/example-configurations/events-generated-from-mib) folder.

Now place the copied `eventconf.xml` file in the [session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc](../session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc) folder.

And place the `CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB.events.xml` file in the [session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/events](../session3/minimal-minion-activemq/container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/events) folder.

(Remember you should be using your copy of the exercise in [/opennms-tutorials-1/myPracticeCourseWork](../../main/myPracticeCourseWork/) )

Going forwards, as you edit these files, you can test them in the running OpenNMS system.

One way to do this is just to restart the docker compose project and the files will be injected.

```
# restart opennms (don`t use -v or you will wait for the database to initialise)
cd minimal-minion-activemq
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```
OpenNMS will fail to start if there is a syntax error in the files, but you can check the problem by looking at the startup logs.

A faster approach with a running system is just to copy the files into the running container's opennms/etc directory and send an event to OpenNMS which will force a reload of eventd. 
To do this try;

```
cd minimal-minion-activemq
docker compose cp ./container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/events/CHUBB-TVBS-CAMERA-MIB.events.xml horizon:/usr/share/opennms/etc/events/

# and if eventconf.xml is not already modified
docker compose cp ./container-fs/horizon/opt/opennms-overlay/etc/eventconf.xml horizon:/usr/share/opennms/etc/

# send an event to reload the daemon (if perl is installed)
docker compose exec horizon /usr/share/opennms/bin/send-event.pl uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig -p 'daemonName Eventd' 
```

Note Perl is not installed by default in newer opennms containers but curl can be used instead (substitute --user username:password as appropriate and note the \" escape characters used in PowerShell)

```
docker compose exec horizon curl --user admin:admin -X POST http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/events -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"uei\": \"uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig\", \"severity\": \"NORMAL\", \"parms\": [{\"parmName\": \"daemonName\", \"value\": \"Eventd\" }]}' 
```

This completes an exercise in generating the raw event configuration files.

In [Exercise-3-4](../session3/Exercise-3-4.md) we will modify and test the event configuration to add alarms.
